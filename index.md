The System Level Design Group is comprised of students and faculty
investigating all aspects of systems level design at The University of
Kansas Information and Telecommunications Technology Center. Advised
by Dr. Perry Alexander, the group is engaged in several research
projects including specification, verification and synthesis of
complex systems, trusted computing, and system-level design. Each
applies engineering methods and formal modeling to specific systems
engineering activities. The System Level Design group is supported by
The University of Kansas' Information and Telecommunication Technology
Center's Computer Systems Design Laboratory.
