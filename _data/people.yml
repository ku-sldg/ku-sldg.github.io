  description: VSPEC Formal Semantics - The syntax and
  semantics of the VSPEC specification language are described. A
  transformation from single and multi-component specifications to
  Larch Shared Language specifications is defined to provide language
  syntax. Component specifications are defined using the canonical
  axiomatic style extended to represent component
  activation. Interconnected components are modeled using CSP to model
  control.

  description: Formal Component Retrieval and Architecture
  Representation - A technique for efficient, correct retrieval of
  components and a theory of architectures is presented. The component
  retrieval system combines faceted retrieval and specification
  matching. Facets are formally defined and extracted from component
  specifications using forward inference. Retrieval based on facets
  culls the solution space making specification matching
  feasible. Architecture theories are used to compose and adapt
  specifications.

  description: VSPEC formal analysis using automatically
  generated proof obligations - Defined and implemented a methodology
  for automatically generating a discharging proof obligations from
  VSPEC specifications. The semantics of VSPEC were encoded in PVS and
  proof obligations to test several classes of interface errors
  generated. Automatic proof scripts are generated with the
  obligations to attempt automated verification.

  description: System Synthesis from a Monadic Functional
  Language - Defined a methodology for synthesizing globally
  asynchronous, locally synchronous (GALS) implementations in VHDL and

  computational features.

  constraints are defined in the Performance Description Language

  was written to output PDL specifications from the JVOM intermediate
  form. The translator is integrated into the orbit environment.

  Translation - A PCCTS based parser and object model is developed to
  provide generic front-end analysis for Larch Shared Language (LSL)
  traits. Semantic checking and symbol table manipulations are
  provided. The object model is then used to develop a translator from
  LSL specifications to PVS theories. Shorthands, induction rules,
  extensionality rules, and other Larch specifics are transformed into
  PVS their equivalents.
