  description: VSPEC Formal Semantics - The syntax and semantics of the VSPEC specification language are described. A transformation from single and multi-component specifications to Larch Shared Language specifications is defined to provide language syntax. Component specifications are defined using the canonical axiomatic style extended to represent component activation. Interconnected components are modeled using CSP to model control.

  description: Formal Component Retrieval and Architecture Representation - A technique for efficient, correct retrieval of components and a theory of architectures is presented. The component retrieval system combines faceted retrieval and specification matching. Facets are formally defined and extracted from component specifications using forward inference. Retrieval based on facets culls the solution space making specification matching feasible. Architecture theories are used to compose and adapt specifications.

  description: Rosetta Composition Semantics - Developed a formal semantics for Rosetta component composition.  Each Rosetta model assumes a co-algebraic semantics, thus composition becomes composition of co-algebras.

  description: Towards a Formal Model of the TPM - Developed a formal model of the TPM v1.2 using PVS.  Command execution sequencing is done using a state monad to thread state through a command sequence.

  description: Polytypic Theorem Proving Framwork - The Prufrock (literary reference intended) polytypic theorem prover famework. Prufrock was developed to perform static anlaysis on Haskell and Rosetta source modules. It is a first-order theorem prover supporting rewriting and a proof scripting language.

  description: VSPEC formal analysis using automatically generated proof obligations - Defined and implemented a methodology for automatically generating a discharging proof obligations from VSPEC specifications. The semantics of VSPEC were encoded in PVS and proof obligations to test several classes of interface errors generated. Automatic proof scripts are generated with the obligations to attempt automated verification.

  description: Formal Semantics for Model-Based Specification - Defined a formal semantics for model-based specification and a denotation for the Rosetta specification language to that formalism. The system is based on using hidden algebras to represent abstract state allowing refinement in specification domains.

  description: System Synthesis from a Monadic Functional Language - Defined a methodology for synthesizing globally asynchronous, locally synchronous (GALS) implementations in VHDL and C++ from a common, monadic specification. The specification language, called Oread, uses monadic constructs to represent various computational features.
