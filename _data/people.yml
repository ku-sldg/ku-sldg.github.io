  description: VSPEC Formal Semantics - The syntax and
  semantics of the VSPEC specification language are described. A
  transformation from single and multi-component specifications to
  Larch Shared Language specifications is defined to provide language
  syntax. Component specifications are defined using the canonical
  axiomatic style extended to represent component
  activation. Interconnected components are modeled using CSP to model
  control.
