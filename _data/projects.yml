  description: "Under the INSPECTA effort with Collins Aerospace we will be developing a lifecycle attestation capability and tools for formally synthesizing Rust specifications from Coq. Lifecycle attestation is gathering and appraising system measurements starting from early design stages and maintaining appraisal over system and requirements changes.  Our Rust synthesis capability will adapt CakeML synthesis tools developed for DARPA CASE.  We will define a synthesis fragment of Rust, retarget our transformation tool, and retarget our certification theorem generation tool."
