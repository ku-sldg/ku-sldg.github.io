The System Level Design Group is comprised of students and faculty investigating all aspects of systems level design at The University of Kansas Information and Telecommunications Technology Center. Advised by Dr. Perry Alexander, the group is engaged in several research projects including specification, verification and synthesis of complex systems as well as component reuse and architecture. Each applies engineering methods and formal modeling to specific systems engineering activities. The System Level Design group is supported by The University of Kansas' Information and Telecommunication Technology Center's Computer Systems Design Laboratory.
