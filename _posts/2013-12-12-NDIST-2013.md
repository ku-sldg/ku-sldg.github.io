title: NDIST'13 (Day 3)
---

Day three continues with interesting talks on biological systems.

### Warren Hunt - Phylogeny

* Working on phylogeny issues.  Building classifications of tree
  structured data.
* TASPI - operates on a classical Scheme tree structure built with
  lists.
  * Common sub-tree reduction to reduce size[^0]
	[^0]: This feels like a classic BDD generation issue
* Every time biologists talk to him they:
  * Don't know how much data they have
  * Don't know how it is structured
* Discussed working from the bottom of the tree up
  * Computer scientists would prefer working from the bottom

Rebuild trees by knowing the occurrence rate of subtrees.
Specifically, know that a tree is constructed from subtrees and
specify those occurrences.

* Bio-Machine encoding scheme
  * Quickly generate trees
  * Mechanical proof possible (associativity, commutativity, and what
    not)
  * Possible method for programmable and generative simulation
    algorithms

### Jacob Beal - Workflow talk

Discussed the concept of a biocompiler that translates "operators" to
"motifs" which is pretty interesting.

* Using compilation optimizations to make biological implementations
  more efficient
  * Copy elimination

### Panel Session - Defenses, Biological and Computational

Can we learn from one another.  Can we avoid repeated mistakes.

#### Howie Schrobe

##### Computation

1. Near perfect components
1. Core design formed in an era of scarcity
1. Core design formed in isolated environment
1. Evolutionary pressure from market - price performance
1. Self-regulation and adaptation rarely considered - Runs open-loop
1. No enterprise-wide survivability mechanisms

##### Biological

1. Failable components
1. Abundance of resources
1. Evolution in ecosystem of predators and parasites
1. Evolutionary pressure from ecosystem - survivability
1. Self-regulation and adaptation are core mechanisms.  Closed loop
control.
1. Diversity for population survival.  Public-health systems in human
society

#### Tom Knight - Biological Protection Mechanisms

* Biology
  1. Replicate cell or system to avoid single points of failure
  1. Biology is in the business of making more copies of itself
  1. Survival and competition is the fundamental strategy
	 * Survival of single cells are not necessary
	 * Evolution plays a central role
   
* DNA Repair
  1. Damage from UV chemicals
  1. Base repair
	 * Damaged single bases
	 * Repair by matching to opposite strand
	 * Identify parent strand with methylation marks
  1. Strand breaks
	 * Homologous end repair - Needs a "matching sequence" on the
       other end
	 * Non-homologous end repair - Highly error prone, desperation move
	 
* DNA Invasion
  1. Restriction enzymes
	 * Protect species DNA with unique marks - methylation of specific
       sequences
	 * Attack and destroy DNA not marked
	 * Works within all cells of a specific species
  1. CRISPERs
	 * Find representative sequences of an attacker
	 * Incorporate these sequences into a list of "likely targets"
	 * Selectively attack these sequences when found
	 * Works at the genetic level (memory across generations)

* Change the Code

* Chemical Attacks (Toxins)
  1. Pump the chemical out of the cell
  1. Actively modify the chemical before it can do harm
  1. Modify your chemistry to be immune to toxin - Change in protein
  sequence or turn on alternative pathways
  
* Inactive sate
  1. Small fractions of cells are active at any time
  
* Multi-cellular immune system
  1. Innate immunity
	 * Present from birth
	 * Detects common pathogen characteristics
	 * General rather than specific
	 * Fast
  1. Acquire immunity
	 * Slow, learned response
	 * Very effective after initial exposure

* Adaptive Immunity
  1. Initial targeting by B cells with poor specificity
  1. High speed mutation of activated B cells
  1. Selection of higher specificity binders
  1. Long term memory of these binders
  1. Targets include not just pathogens, but also cell internals
	 * Presentation of short peptides by all cells in MHC
	 * Comparison to learned "self"
	 * Detection of e.g. cancers, mutations
	 * Programmed cell death

## Howie Shrobe (again)

> At least 20-30% of the body's resources are involved in constant
surveillance and containment.

Part of the innate immune system engages the adaptive immune system

#### Adaptive immunity

1. Hardware analog of immune system detects anomaly
1. Software system analog of adaptive immune system is signaled
1. System model is used to perform diagnosis
1. System model is adapted with new attack-specific detector
1. Adaptive immune system synthesizes plan to get around problem and
patch to remove specific vulnerability

Workforce & Degradation is the Economic Trade-off

#### Processes of attacker and defender

Attacker:
1. Recon
1. Penetration
1. Escalation
1. Exploitation

Defender:
1. Detection
1. Diagnosis
1. Remediation
1. Regeneration

Originally the subsystem that was exploited by the Car Shark system
was isolated from the real-time control systems. But, to make
diagnostics and only updating work, these were later bridged.
*Bingo!*

Stuxnet attacked a system that was air-gapped.

### Pat Lincoln - 

Premises from 2000 are still valid

1. We can not control the distribution of technology and information
enabling the manipulation of biological systems
1. Ineffective attempts to forbid access to basic biology manipulation
incur high cost
   * Delayed gains
   * Missed opportunities
1. Threats could arise form nature, nation states, loosely organized
groups, and individual
1. Threats could target any part of the living world relevant to human
welfare

1. Biosafety
   * What do you protect
	 1. Humans
	 1. Agriculture
	 1. Ecology of niches
	 1. Gaia
   * From what do you protect it
	 1. Organisms from elsewhere and other times
	 1. Unintended consequences of organisms and parts designed by humans
	 1. Organisms and parts that are newly synthesized
  
1. Biosecurity - Security against humans doing bad things with biotech.

1. Mitigation of risks:

	1. Speed
	1. Cultural
	1. Legal
	1. Technical
	   * Telomere-like generation counters [^2]
	   * Alien-like overlapping code regions
	   * Random parity-like signature checks
   
[^2]:Telomere limits replication to a specific number of generations
