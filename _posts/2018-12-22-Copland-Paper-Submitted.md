title: Copland Paper Submitted
---
With colleagues at NSA, MITRE, and JHUAPL we submitted the first paper
on Copland to POST'19.  The paper describes the semantics of
attestation protocol terms and correctness properties.  The paper is
currently udner consideration, but the Coq proofs are available on the
[Copland site](https://ku-sldg.github.io/copland/).
