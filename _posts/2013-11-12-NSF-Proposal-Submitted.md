*Synthesizing Software Infrastructure for Remote Attestation*
submitted with Andy Gill and Prasad Kulkarning to the NSF SaTC
program.  This work proposes to autmatically synthesize remote
attestation support for user-space applications.  Without such
support, it will be difficult to field trusted computing techniques
for applications that require sophisticated measurement capabilities.
This work will synthesize components that plug into our
ArmoredSoftware infrastructure.
