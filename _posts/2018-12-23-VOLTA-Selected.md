Adventium has been informed that our proposal _Vulnerabilities Out of
Learned Timed Automata (VOLTA)_ bas been selected for funding by The
Air Force Research Laboratory.  We will be using our Copland
infrastructure to discover properties of timed automata through
measurement.  Great news that we will be working with Adventium again.
