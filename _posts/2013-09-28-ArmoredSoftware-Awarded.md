title: ArmoredSoftware Awarded
---
We are pleased to announce a new DoD award to investigate trusted
execution in cloud computing environments.   [ArmoredSoftware](http://armoredsoftware.github.io) uses
trusted computing techniques to build "armor" for cloud processes.
The armor assesses the state of its associated process and the state
of the cloud it currently executes in.  Based on those assessments,
the armor takes actions such as migrating processes to redude risk of
an untrusted execution environment.
