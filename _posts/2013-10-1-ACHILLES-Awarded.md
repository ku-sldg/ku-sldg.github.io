title: ACHILLES Awarded
---
We are exicited to announce that we are under contract with Adventium
Labs for the DARPA sponsored ACHILLES project.  ACHILLES seeks to
define and discover malice in embedded systems.  SLDG researchers
will work on a subsystem to test for capabilities in systems with the
intent of defining device models.  Adventium researchers will develop
plans from those device models and attacker profiles that represent
potential attack vectors.  We are thankful to DARPA and Adventium for
supporting our work.
