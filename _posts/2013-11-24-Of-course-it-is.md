Resursion is your friend.  It will always be your friend.  When
iteration fails, when nastly little variables named `x` seem to be
everywhere around you, when the pointy stick of looping past the end
of a list jabs you in the eye, recursion will always be there.
Of course [it is its own reward](http://xkcd.com/1270/)
