# Administrative Flotsam

## New Student Information

### Papers to Read

* [The 10 Page Introduction to Trusted Computing](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0536/3b5049fb581d5ca8ef1c589417f3e5be2b64.pdf)
* [Principles of Remote Attestation](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~guttman/pubs/good_attest.pdf)
* [Fold and Unfold for Program Semantics](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/semantics.pdf)

### Tools to Install

* emacs - I don't absolutely require emacs, but it's easier when we all use the same tools.  Emacs also talks to Coq, GHC and LaTeX quite well.  Atom is also a good option.
* GHC - The easiest thing to do is install the Haskell Platform.  This will give you just about everything you need.  Haskell mode for emacs is a must if you choose emacs.  I have not successfully installed
* Coq - The easiest thing to do is install the CoqIDE.  Alternatively, use OPAM to install Coq and then install Proof General for emacs from the Proof General github repo.
* LaTeX - There are pre-built LaTeX installations for virtually every OS platform.  Pick your favorite, but TeXLive is a great option.  AucTeX and RefTeX for emacs are also great additions for interacting with LaTeX and BibTeX files.  A standard BibTeX file exists for the lab to make citations simpler.

We have a number of Linux desktops and servers if you prefer to use ITTC equipment for your work.  I don't care what platform you use as long as you are saving work to our GitHub repos and using `/projects` and `/tools` when appropriate.

### Things to Set Up

* GitHub - We collaborate on virtually everything through GitHub.  You need to get a GitHub ID and request to be added to the SLDG projects and ArmoredSoftware project.  KU-SLDG is where all our active projects live.  ArmoredSoftware is a legacy effort, but it's handy to have access.
* slack - We communicate using slack.  You need to get invited to the KU-SLDG space and the KU-CSDL space.  The former is for our lab and the latter is for the Computer Systems Design Laboratory that we are a part of.
