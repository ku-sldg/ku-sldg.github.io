# Administrative Flotsam

## New Student Information

### Papers to Read

* [The 10 Page Introduction to Trusted Computing](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0536/3b5049fb581d5ca8ef1c589417f3e5be2b64.pdf)
* [Principles of Remote Attestation](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~guttman/pubs/good_attest.pdf)
* [Fold and Unfold for Program Semantics](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/semantics.pdf)

### Tools to Install

* `emacs` or `vscode` - Both interface with our toolchain well. `emacs` for
  the old school among us. `vscode` for for the next generation.
* `Coq` - `OPAM` to install `OCaml` and `Coq` and then either install `Proof General` for
  `emacs` from the Proof General github repo or install `vscoq` in
  `vscode`. Both are quite good.
* `LaTeX` - There are pre-built `LaTeX` installations for virtually every
  OS platform.  Pick your favorite, but `TeXLive` is a great option.
  `AucTeX` and `RefTeX` for `emacs` are also great additions for interacting
  with `LaTeX` and `BibTeX` files.  A standard `BibTeX` file exists for the
  lab to make citations simpler. 

We have a number of Linux desktops and servers if you prefer to use
I2S equipment for your work.  I can get you `sudo` permissions if you
need them.

### Things to Set Up

* `GitHub` - We collaborate on virtually everything through GitHub.  You
  need to get a GitHub ID and request to be added to the SLDG
  projects.  `KU-SLDG` is where all our active projects live.
* `teams` - We communicate using `teams` chat and `teams` meetings.
  `the_band` is our private team for discussing lab things.
